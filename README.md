Do note that I have set the pointer position according to the length of the data I am entering in the text file. Some of the things which I had assumed are the registration number is always 9 characters long, subject code is either CSE1001/CSE1002, proctor ID is 4 characters long, marks is just 2 characters long. You would need to change the code accordingly if you want to enter some other type of data.
